ButtonLog UX/UI View by Designer

Task: develop ux/ui for the button log application.

To achieve the result, the following criteria were set for ux markup:
- design should be user-oriented.
- ux markup should have a minimum of screens.
- design should be implementable for developers.

Based on UX requirements and Product Owner requirements, the following specifications were developed for the UI interface:
- style: minimalism.

The UX scheme was based on the scheme from [ProdOwnerView.md](./Specification/Design/ProdOwnerView/ProdOwnerView.md)

After clarification of the task, the following changes were made to the customer's UX scheme:
- the side drop-down menu was removed and replaced with a lower central menu

After 1st iteration of Ui developing such changes were made:
- color palette: white, black and shades.

The development of the UI interface was divided into iterations.

The results of each iteration have been added to the repository, accompanied by a link to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) document.

As a result, there is such list of iterations:

[Iteration1.md](./Specification/Design/DesignerView/Iteration1.md)
[Iteration2.md](./Specification/Design/DesignerView/Iteration2.md)
[Iteration3.md](./Specification/Design/DesignerView/Iteration3.md)
The last iteration was taken as the resulting [approved design]_(./Specification/Design/ApprovedDesign/ApprovedDesign.md)
